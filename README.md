Created Project sshTestMe
allowed XCode 5 to create a GIT repo in project

Created a repo sshTestMe on github set to ssh

in terminal
cd /Users/wet/dev/xDev/TestMe 
git remote add origin git@github.com:BarryNelson/sshTestMe.git

NOTE: github recommends 'git push -u origin master', but it will not work

Now project is tied into the github repository.
Commit, Push, Pull, etc should work now.
